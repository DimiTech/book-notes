# Book Notes
Here I'll post my notes from various books that I'm reading so I can review them at a later time and so that others can gain valuable insight from them quickly.

I mostly put stuff in the notes that seems profound or interesting to me (at the time of reading the book) and that I wouldn't want to forget.

I update book notes regularly.
